# Stilren with TypeScript and Next.js example

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript and Stilren.

Stilren is a wrapper around the css-in-js lib styletron with the difference being how that functionality is exposed to the developer. Stilren basically adds css properties as top level props. A little hacky approach, but the dev UX is really something.

```
<button $backgroundColor="red" $opacityHover="0.5">Red button</button>

// translates to roughly:

.button1 {
  backgroundColor: red;
}

.button2:hover {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

// The classnames are autogenerated individual for each key value pair.
```
